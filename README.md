## DA_Final_Project-Performance-of-Athletes-in-Crossfit

# Project Objective
This is the final project of the Data Analyst Course at Iron Hack. To understand the characteristics and performance of Crossfit Athlete, a comprehensive dataset from competitions and events around the world will be analyze. As a data analyst the main objective is understand the physiological and psychological factors that contribute to successful Crossfit Performance. Crossfit is a sport of high intensity work-outs combine with weightlifting, gymnastics and cardio exercises. This dataset includes information on athlete demographics, such as age,gender and training experience, as well as their performance metrics, such as time, weight lifted, eating habits, experience and background. It was carried out an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  key performance indicator (KPI) identification, hypothesis testing, , and a comprehensive review on athlete performance in different context and settings. It was use Tableau, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Plotly Graph and Plotly Express to produce visuals and useful insights. Addressing statistical significance, this project aim to provide usefull insight information into the characteristics and performance of Crossfit Athletes, enabling crossfit trainers develop evidence-based science training programs that support athletes to achieved there highest performance, optimize their physical abilities and reduce the risk of injury.  

## Methods

 - ### Data Cleaning 
    Athlete_Data_Set
    - Copying DF to a new DF to avoid manipulated the original
    - Dropped unwanted columns[ID,Names,team,affiliate]
    - Deal with Nan values
        -  Calculate % of missing values for each column
        -  Checked columns with large number of Nan Values
        -  Dropped Nan values

# Data Import to Python 
   - Featured Engineer
        - Create function to divide each column in specific groups
        - Applying functions to respective columns
        - Checking if any Nan values on the new DF created
        - Basic EDA Steps
        - Checking for outliers
        - Checking Distribution
        - Checking Correlation
        - Plotting Points of Interest

# Project Description

This a valuable dataset collected from competitions and events around the world to better understand the characteristics and performance of a Crossfit Athlete. This data set were selected and organized to allow for a thorough imvestigation for fitness researchers and fitness trainers who are interested in understanding the physiological and psychological factors that contribute to successful CrossFit performance.  At the same time the crossfit community is growing and the groups are diversifying with varying levels of fitness, this information could be used to develops evidence-based training programs that support their physical and mental wellbeing. 

This data includes information on athlete demographics, such as age, gender, height, weight, and training experience, as well as performance metrics, such as time, weight lifted, eat habits and background as athlete. It was performed a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using python tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Plotly Graph and Plotly Express in order to identify patterns, distributions, correlations, and possible outliers in these datasets. It was work through complexities of the datasets to make sure that any problems with data cleaning were quickly resolved, to determine the integrity and dependability of the results. These dataset will form the foundation insights to provide a wealth information on athlete performance in differente context and settings

# Steps for Reproducing the data 

1. # Original Data:
    - Open the data/raw directory to view the original dataset.
2. # Data Cleaning:
    - To clean up the date, use the athletes.ipynb notebook located in the notebook directory. The data/clean directory will house the   
    cleansed data.
3. # Hypothesis Testing:
   - Run the athletes
